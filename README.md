For my personal project, I decided to examine United States government data on the number of weapons sold under Title 22, Foreign Military Sales, and the amount of foreign aid these countries received. My goal was to determine whether there were any correlations in the data and whether they changed when the data were sorted by region or when specific parameters were added. My data comes from the Department of Defence's fiscal year (FY) 2024 edition of the Historical Sales Book, as well as from ForeignAssistance.gov, which provides a CSV file of a country-by-country summary of foreign aid.
