Intro:
For my personal project, I decided to examine United States government data on the number of weapons sold in 2024 under Title 22, Foreign Military Sales, and the amount of foreign aid these countries received in the same year. My goal was to determine whether there were any correlations in the data and whether they changed when the data were sorted by region or when specific parameters were added. My data comes from the Department of Defence's fiscal year (FY) 2024 edition of the Historical Sales Book, as well as from ForeignAssistance.gov, which provides a CSV file of a country-by-country summary of foreign aid.  
Data Processing:
To begin, I had to fix many errors that occurred when copying the data. For example, many of the country names did not match, i.e., Saint Vincent vs St. Vincent. I also had to group all these countries by region myself later, since I initially did not know I wanted to do a region-by-region analysis. I also had to remove countries that did not appear on the military sales list, as that meant they had not traded officially under Title 22 since 1950, and since I was examining 2024, this was not necessary. Additionally, the Historical Sales Book contained countries that no longer exist (Yugoslavia) or entities that were not countries at all (NATO). Once I began processing my data, I found it crucial to remove certain outliers so I could get a clearer picture after my preliminary research.
